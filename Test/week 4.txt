1) Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. 
Find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station
so that no train is kept waiting.

Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same day. 
Arrival and departure time can never be the same for a train but we can have arrival
time of one train equal to departure time of other. At any given instance of time, 
same platform can not be used for both departure of a train and arrival of another train. 
In such cases
we need defferent platfrms.

ex1:
ip : n=6
arr[] = {0900 0940 0950 1100 1500 1800}
dep[] = {0910 1200 1120 1130 1900 2000}
op : 3

exxplanation :
Min 3 platforms are required to safely arrive and depart all trains.

2) Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K, you have to modify
the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by K only once. After modifying 
height should be a non-negative integer.

find out the minimum possible difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have 
modified each tower.

NOTE: It is compulsory to increase or decrease(if possible) by K to each tower.

ex1:
K=2
N=4
arr[] = {1,5,8,10}

op:
Array can be modified as {3,3,6,8}.
The difference b/w largest and smallest is 8-3=5.
